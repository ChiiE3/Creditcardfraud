# FraudDetection
Context
Blossom Bank also known as BB PLC is a multinational financial services group, that offers retail and investment banking, pension management, asset management and payments services, headquartered in London, UK.

Problem
Blossom Bank wants to build a Machine Learning model to predict online payment fraud.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to explore and to identify fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments on finanacial transactions in Blossom bank. 
Model utilised in this project to detect the fraudulent transactions involves decision tree classifier, naive bayes and logistic regression models. 
The most efficient model can be used by the bank to automatically predict and prevent fraud across the organisation which will help keep the customers and their money safe.

Dataset
The dataset contains historical information about fraudulent transactions from Blossom bank which can be used to detect fraud in online payments.

Step 1 : Data Preparation
- Imported the necessary data libraries
- Imported the dataset
- Understanding the dataset by learning the various Data Types, info, statistics etc
- To prepare the data for analysis, the dataset was cleaned.

Step 2: Exploratory data analysis
- Conducted univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis.
- Visualized relationships between the label and some key features
- Explored the distribution frequencies in the data columns.
- Explored correlations between the columns.


Step 3: Feature engineering
- Encoded categorical variables

Step 4: Model selection, training, and validation
- Trained and tested 4 supervised learning models: Logistic Regression

, Decision Tree Classifier and Naive Bayes Model

Step 5: Model evaluation
- Analysed the results of trained models.

Challenge
There is a huge difference between fraudulent and non fraudulent data which reflects data imbalance in the dataset.
